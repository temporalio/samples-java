## Requirements

- Java 1.8+ for build and runtime
- Java 11+ for development and contribution

## How to use

1. Clone this repository:

       git clone https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java
       cd samples-java

2. Build the examples and run tests:

       ./gradlew build

3. You need a locally running Temporal Server instance to run the samples. We recommend a locally running
   version of the Temporal Server managed via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/):

       git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
       cd  docker-compose
       docker-compose up

Note that for the "listworkflows" example you need to have the Elasticsearch feature
enabled on the Temporal Server side. To do this you can run locally with:

       git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
       cd  docker-compose
       docker-compose -f docker-compose-cass-es.yml up

Alternatively you could install the Temporal Server on Kubernetes / Minicube using the [Temporal Helm charts](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts).
Note that in this case you should use the [Temporal CLI (tctl)](https://docs.temporal.io/tctl-v1) tool to create a namespace called "default":

       tctl --ns default n re

## Temporal Web UI

The Temporal Server running in a docker container includes a Web UI, exposed by default on port 8080 of the docker host.
If you are running Docker on your host, you can connect to the WebUI running using a browser and opening the following URI:

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

If you are running Docker on a different host (e.g.: a virtual machine), then modify the URI accordingly by specifying the correct host and the correct port.

[http://${DOCKER_HOST}:${WEBUI_PORT}](http://${DOCKER_HOST}:${WEBUI_PORT}).

If you have deployed the Temporal Server on Kubernetes using Helm Charts, you can use the kubectl command-line tool
to forward your local machine ports to the Temporal Web UI:

        kubectl port-forward services/temporaltest-web 8088:8088
        kubectl port-forward services/temporaltest-frontend-headless 7233:7233

With this you should be able to access the Temporal Web UI with [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088).

## Running samples

By default, samples assume relevant Temporal container ports are listening on `localhost`, on port `7233`.
If this is not the case, you can tunnel traffic to this port to a different one (even running on a different host), using for example `netcat`, `socat`, or `ssh`.

If, for example, you're running Docker on a virtual machine `vm`, you can use `ssh` to tunnel the traffic using the following command before running the samples:

```
ssh -g -L 7233:localhost:7233 -N user@vm
```

## Samples directory

The following section lists all available samples.
Click on the sample link to view the README, which contains instructions on how to run them.

Each sample has an associated unit test which demonstrates the use of the Temporal Java SDK testing API.
All tests are available under [src/test/java](./src/test/java/io/temporal/samples)

### Scenario-based samples

- [**File Processing Sample**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/fileprocessing): Demonstrates how to route tasks to specific Workers. This sample has a set of Activities that download a file, processes it, and uploads the result to a destination. Any Worker can execute the first Activity. However, the second and third Activities must be executed on the same host as the first one.

- [**Booking SAGA**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/bookingsaga): Demonstrates Temporals take on the Camunda BPMN "trip booking" example.

- [**Money Transfer**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/moneytransfer): Demonstrates the use of a dedicated Activity Worker.

- [**Money Batch**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/moneybatch): Demonstrates a situation where a single deposit should be initiated for multiple withdrawals. For example, a seller might want to be paid once per fixed number of transactions. This sample can be easily extended to perform a payment based on more complex criteria, such as at a specific time or an accumulated amount. The sample also demonstrates how to Signal the Workflow when it executes (*Signal with start*). If the Workflow is already executing, it just receives the Signal. If it is not executing, then the Workflow executes first, and then the Signal is delivered to it. *Signal with start* is a "lazy" way to execute Workflows when Signaling them.

- [**Customer Application Approval DSL**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/dsl): Demonstrates execution of a customer application approval workflow defined in a DSL (like JSON or YAML)

- [**Polling Services**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/polling): Recommended implementation of an activity that needs to periodically poll an external resource waiting its successful completion

- [**Heartbeating Activity Batch**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/batch/heartbeatingactivity): Batch job implementation using a heartbeating activity.

- [**Iterator Batch**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/batch/iterator): Batch job implementation using the workflow iterator pattern.

- [**Sliding Window Batch**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/batch/slidingwindow): A batch implementation that maintains a configured number of child workflows during processing.

### API demonstrations

- [**Updatable Timer**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/updatabletimer): Demonstrates the use of a helper class which relies on `Workflow.await` to implement a blocking sleep that can be updated at any moment.

- [**Workflow Count Interceptor**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/countinterceptor): Demonstrates how to create and register a simple Workflow Count Interceptor.
- 
- [**Workflow Retry On Signal Interceptor**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/retryonsignalinterceptor): Demonstrates how to create and register an interceptor that retries an activity on a signal.

- [**Payload Converter - Crypto**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/payloadconverter/crypto): Demonstrates the use of a custom payload converter using jackson-json-crypto.

- [**Async Child Workflow**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/asyncchild): Demonstrates how to invoke a child workflow async, that can complete after parent workflow is already completed.

- [**Terminate Workflow**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/terminateworkflow): Demonstrates how to terminate a workflow using client API.

- [**Per Activity Type Options**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/peractivityoptions): Demonstrates how to set per Activity type options.

- [**Configure WorkflowClient to use mTLS**](./src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/ssl): Demonstrates how to configure WorkflowClient when using mTLS.
