/**
 * Hello World Temporal workflow that executes a single local activity. Requires a local instance
 * the Temporal service to be running.
 *
 * <p>Some of the Activities are very short lived and do not need the queuing semantic, flow
 * control, rate limiting and routing capabilities. For these Temporal supports so called local
 * Activity feature. Local Activities are executed in the same worker process as the Workflow that
 * invoked them. Consider using local Activities for functions that are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>no longer than a few seconds
 *   <li>do not require global rate limiting
 *   <li>do not require routing to specific workers or pools of workers
 *   <li>can be implemented in the same binary as the Workflow that invokes them
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The main benefit of local Activities is that they are much more efficient in utilizing
 * Temporal service resources and have much lower latency overhead comparing to the usual Activity
 * invocation.
